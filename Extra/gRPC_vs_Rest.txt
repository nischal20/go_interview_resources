Why gRPC is faster than REST:

Protocol Efficiency:

gRPC uses HTTP/2 (binary protocol), supporting multiplexing and reducing latency.
REST uses HTTP/1.1 (text-based protocol), typically leading to larger data sizes and increased transmission time.
Serialization:

gRPC uses Protocol Buffers (protobuf),which is a binary serialization format and is compact and faster to serialize/deserialize.
REST uses JSON, which is text-based, larger in size, and slower to process.
Communication Model:

gRPC supports efficient streaming (client-side, server-side, and bi-directional).
REST primarily uses request-response communication, adding latency for each interaction.
Built-in Features:

gRPC has built-in support for load balancing, retries, deadlines, and cancellations.
REST requires separate implementation for these features, increasing overhead.
Type Safety and Contract First:

gRPC ensures strong typing and a contract-first approach with Interface Definition Language (IDL).
REST often involves dynamic typing and a contract-last approach, potentially leading to inefficiencies.
Performance Benchmarks:

gRPC typically outperforms REST in high-frequency, low-latency communication scenarios.
REST is more performant for simpler CRUD operations but generally lags in raw performance compared to gRPC.
These points highlight the architectural and operational efficiencies that make gRPC a faster option for certain use cases, particularly in high-performance microservices and internal service-to-service communication.
