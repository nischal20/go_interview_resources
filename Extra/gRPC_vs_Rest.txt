Why gRPC is faster than REST:

Protocol Efficiency:
gRPC uses HTTP/2 (binary protocol), supporting multiplexing and reducing latency.
REST uses HTTP/1.1 (text-based protocol), typically leading to larger data sizes and increased transmission time.

Serialization:
gRPC uses Protocol Buffers (protobuf),which is a binary serialization format and is compact and faster to serialize/deserialize.
REST uses JSON, which is text-based, larger in size, and slower to process.

Protobuf's binary serialization format results in a message that is approximately half the size of the equivalent JSON representation. This compactness leads to more efficient data transmission, particularly beneficial in bandwidth-constrained environments and high-performance applications. The reduced message size directly translates to lower latency and higher throughput, making Protobuf and gRPC a more efficient choice compared to JSON and REST for many use cases.

Communication Model:
gRPC supports efficient streaming (client-side, server-side, and bi-directional).
REST primarily uses request-response communication, adding latency for each interaction.

gRPC Streaming:

Connection Efficiency: Uses a single connection for multiple messages.
Reduced Latency: Real-time updates with minimal delay.
Resource Utilization: Efficient use of bandwidth and server resources.
REST:

Connection Overhead: Each request-response cycle introduces latency.
Polling Drawbacks: Inefficient for real-time updates due to frequent requests.
WebSockets Complexity: Adds complexity and deviates from standard REST practices.

Built-in Features:
gRPC has built-in support for load balancing, retries, deadlines, and cancellations.
REST requires separate implementation for these features, increasing overhead.
gRPC has excellent support for load balancing and service discovery, which makes it easy to deploy and manage large-scale distributed systems making it an ideal choice for building large-scale distributed systems that can handle high volumes of traffic. This can significantly reduce the operational overhead of managing complex systems, allowing developers to focus on building great applications.

Type Safety and Contract First:
gRPC ensures strong typing and a contract-first approach with Interface Definition Language (IDL).
REST often involves dynamic typing and a contract-last approach, potentially leading to inefficiencies.

Performance Benchmarks:
gRPC typically outperforms REST in high-frequency, low-latency communication scenarios.
REST is more performant for simpler CRUD operations but generally lags in raw performance compared to gRPC.

These points highlight the architectural and operational efficiencies that make gRPC a faster option for certain use cases, particularly in high-performance microservices and internal service-to-service communication.
